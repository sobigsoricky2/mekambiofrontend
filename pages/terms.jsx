            verification a special Badge applies to the Expert&quot;s profile and the

            The Services provide connection to Experts who are willing to be
            engaged by Professionals and Parents or Companies as independent
            contractors. As independent contractors, each Expert decides when
            and how often the Expert will be available to provide coaching
            and/or mentoring to Professionals (except that inactivity for 180
            consecutive days may result in deletion of a Experts’ account). Each
            Expert controls the methods, materials, content and all aspects of
            the Expert’s session. Any sample coaching and/or mentoring packages
            or any other materials that may be made available to Experts are for
            an Expert to review or not review and to use or not use in the

            subject- specific coaching and/or mentoring packages for certain
            number of hours that may occur over a number of coaching and/or
            mentoring sessions (each session individually a “ Expert Session”
            collectively the “Expert Package”). Professionals are responsible
            for selecting the right Experts for their needs. Professionals
            should review and investigate each Expert&quot;s self-reported
            credentials, education, and experience, as well as reviews from
            other Parents and/or Professionals. All coaching and/or mentoring
            sessions should be supervised by a responsible adult. Each Expert
            has the sole discretion to accept or decline or continue or
            discontinue a coaching and/or mentoring relationship with any
            Professional.
