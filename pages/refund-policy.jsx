          <h3>3. Fees</h3>

            Fees might apply, such as international transaction fees and foreign
            exchange fees, and the amount listed on your bank statement may be
            different from the amount shown at checkout if your payment is

            fluctuations and meKambio hereby disclaims all liability in that
            regard.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have any questions about the fees or the applicable exchange
            rates, we suggest you contact your bank or credit card company.

          </p>
          <h3>4. Cancellation of Sessions</h3>
          <p>
            Sessions can be cancelled any time up to 12 hours before the session
            is due to start and rescheduled thereafter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Otherwise, you are liable to be charged the full amount for the
            scheduled session, unless the expert agrees not to charge you after
            a formal discussion.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right for every Expert to charge the cost of the
            Session that is cancelled less than 12 hours before its due time,
            without the possibility of this amount being refunded to the
            Professional.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Reschedule of Sessions</h3>
          <p>
            Sessions can be rescheduled through your meKambio account easily up
            to 12 hours before the Session is due. Professionals and Experts
            have the possibility to reschedule each Session once each. The
            reschedule date and time must be accepted by the other part,
            Professional or Expert, for this to happen.
          </p>
          <h3>6. Refunds</h3>

          <p>

            or needs to be cancelled at short notice, these refunds can be made
            at the Expert’s discretion, but there is no obligation on the Expert
            to do so.
